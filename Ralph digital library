Certainly! Here's a simple example code that demonstrates the basic structure of a digital 

```python
# Create a new Django project
# Run the following command in your terminal: django-admin startproject digital_library

# Create a new Django app within the project
# Run the following command in your terminal: python manage.py startapp library_app

# In settings.py, add 'library_app' to the 'INSTALLED_APPS' list

# In urls.py, add the following code:
# from django.urls import path, include
# urlpatterns = [
#     path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
#     path('api/', include('library_app.urls')),
# ]

# Create the models.py file within the library_app folder and define the models

from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    birth_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    publication_date = models.DateField()
    description = models.TextField()
    cover_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='book_covers/')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

# Run migrations using the following commands in your terminal:
# python manage.py makemigrations
# python manage.py migrate

# Create serializers.py file within the library_app folder and define the serializers

from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Author, Book

class AuthorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Author
        fields = '__all__'

class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    author = AuthorSerializer()

    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = '__all__'

# Create views.py file within the library_app folder and define the views

from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Author, Book
from .serializers import AuthorSerializer, BookSerializer

class AuthorViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Author.objects.all()
    serializer_class = AuthorSerializer

class BookViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer

# Create urls.py within the library_app folder and define the URLs

from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import AuthorViewSet, BookViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register('authors', AuthorViewSet)
router.register('books', BookViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
]

# Run the server using the following command in your terminal:
# python manage.py runserver

# You can now access the digital library API at http://localhost:8000/api/
```

Please note that this code is a basic example and may require additional modifications and implementations based on your specific requirements. Also, make sure to install the necessary dependencies like Django and Django REST Framework before running the code.
